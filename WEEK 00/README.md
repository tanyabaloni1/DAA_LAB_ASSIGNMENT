# Problem 01: Linear Search

## Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, design a linear search algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether a given key element is present in the array or not. Also, find the total number of comparisons for each input case. (Time Complexity = O(n), where n is the size of input).

## Input Format:
The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there will be two input lines. First line contains n (the size of array) and key element. Second line contains space-separated integers describing array.

## Output Format:
*The output will have T number of lines. *For each test case T, there will be only one output line containg index of that key element and number of comparisions. *If the key element is not present in array, then print -1 as its index.

## Sample Input:
3 8 89 34 35 65 31 25 89 64 30 5 244 977 354 244 546 355 6 63 23 64 13 67 43 56

## Sample Output:
5 6 2 3 -1 6
