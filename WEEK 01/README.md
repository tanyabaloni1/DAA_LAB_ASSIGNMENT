# Problem 01: Linear Search
## Problem Statement:
Given an array of nonnegative integers, design a linear algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether a given key element is present in the array or not. Also, find the total number of comparisons for each input case. (Time Complexity = O(n), where n is the size of input)

## Input Format:
The first line contains a number of test cases, T. For each test case, there will be three input lines. First line contains n (the size of array). Second line contains n space-separated integers describing the array. Third line contains the key element that needs to be searched in the array.

## Output Format:
The output will have a T number of lines. For each test case, output will be “Present” if the key element is found in the array, otherwise “Not Present”. Also for each test case output the number of comparisons required to search the key

## Sample Input:
3 8 34 35 65 31 25 89 64 30 89 5 977 354 244 546 355 244 6 23 64 13 67 43 56 63

## Sample Output:
Present 6 Present 3 Not Present 6

# Problem 02: Binary Search
## Problem Statement:
Given an already sorted array of positive integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether a given key element is present in the array or not. Also, find the total number of comparisons for each input case. (Time Complexity = O(logn), where n is the size of input).

## Input Format:
The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there will be two input lines. First line contains n (the size of array). Second line contains space-separated integers describing array.

## Output Format:
The output will have T number of lines. For each test case T, there will be three output lines. First line will give the sorted array. Second line will give total number of comparisons. Third line will give total number of swaps required.

## Sample Input:
3 5 12 23 36 39 41 41 8 21 39 40 45 51 54 68 72 69 10 101 246 438 561 796 896 899 4644 7999 8545 7999

## Sample Output:
Present 3 Not Present 4 Present 3

# Problem 03: Jump Search
## Problem Statement:
Given an already sorted array of positive integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether a given key element is present in the sorted array or not. For an array arr[] of size n and block (to be jumped) size m, search at the indexes arr[0], arr[m], arr[2m].....arr[km] and so on. Once the interval (arr[km] < key < arr[ (k+1)m ]) is found, perform a linear search operation from the index km to find the element key. (Time Complexity = O(√n), where n is the number of elements need to be scanned for searching).

## Input Format:
The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there will be three input lines. First line contains n (the size of array). Second line contains space-separated integers describing array.
Third line contains k.

## Output Format:
The output will have T number of lines. For each test case, output will be kth smallest or greatest number. If kth is not present, then print "Not Present".

## Sample Input:
3 5 12 23 36 39 41 41 8 21 39 40 45 51 54 68 72 69 10 101 246 438 561 796 896 899 4644 7999 8545 7999

## Sample Output:
Present 3 Not Present 4 Present 5

# Problem 04: Exponential Search
## Problem Statement:
Given an already sorted array of positive integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether a given key element is present in the sorted array or not. For an array arr[] of size n, search at the indexes arr[0], arr[1], arr[2], arr[4],.....,arr[2^k] and so on. Once the interval (arr[2^k ] < key < arr[2^(k+1)]) is found, perform a linear search or binary search operation from the index 2^k to find the element key. (Complexity = O(logn), where n is the number of elements need to be scanned for searching):

## Input Format:
The first line contains number of test cases, T. For each test case, there will be three input lines. First line contains n (the size of array). Second line contains space-separated integers describing array.
Third line contains k.

## Output Format:
The output will have T number of lines. For each test case, output will be kth smallest or greatest number. If kth is not present, then print "Not Present".

## Sample Input:
3 5 12 23 36 39 41 41 8 21 39 40 45 51 54 68 72 69 10 101 246 438 561 796 896 899 4644 7999 8545 7999

## Sample Output:
Present 5 Not Present 7 Present 6
